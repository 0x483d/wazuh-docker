# Wazuh containers for Docker 

In this repository you will find the containers to run:

* Wazuh server: It runs the Wazuh manager, Wazuh API and Filebeat (for integration with Elastic Stack)
* Logstash: It is used to receive alerts generated by the manager and feed Elasticsearch using an alerts template
* Kibana: Provides a web user interface to browse through alerts data. It includes Wazuh plugin for Kibana, that allows you to visualize agents configuration and status.

In addition, a docker-compose file is provided to launch the containers mentioned above. It also launches an Elasticsearch container (working as a single-node cluster) using Elastic Stack Docker images.

## Current release

Containers are currently tested on Wazuh version 2.0 and Elastic Stack version 5.4.2. We will do our best to keep this repository updated to latest versions of both Wazuh and Elastic Stack.

## Installation note

Kibana container can take a few minutes to install Wazuh plugin, this is perfectly normal.
